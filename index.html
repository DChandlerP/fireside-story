        <p><h1>It was a dark and story night...</h1> the rain fell in torrents, except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which ...and our hero felt himself being stalked in the corn field.  </p>
        <p>Well, shucks. He didn't have a kernel of sense, of course.</p>
        <p>What! No Kernel of sense? Why even a Private's got enough sense to get out of the rain. Why didn't he go and find an empty kennel? Doggoneit!</p>
